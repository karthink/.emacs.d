;;; Commentary:

;; This is an enhancement of shell-command, shell-command-on-region,
;; grep, grep-find, and compile, that enables tab-completion of
;; commands and dir/filenames within their input contexts.

;; The latest version of this program can be downloaded from
;; http://namazu.org/~tsuchiya/elisp/shell-command.el.

;;; Install:

;; Install this file to appropriate directory, and put these lines
;; into your ~/.emacs.

;; Purpose of this package: minor mode to repeat typing or commands
;;
;; Installation instructions
;;
;; Install this file somewhere in your load path, byte-compile it and
;; add one of the following to your .emacs file (remove the comment
;; delimiters ;-)
;;
;; If you only want dot-mode to activate when you press "C-.", add the
;; the following to your .emacs:
;;
;;     (autoload 'dot-mode "dot-mode" nil t) ; vi `.' command emulation
;;     (global-set-key [(control ?.)] (lambda () (interactive) (dot-mode 1)
;;                                       (message "Dot mode activated.")))
;;
;; If you want dot-mode all the time (like me), add the following to
;; your .emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'dot-mode)
;;     (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'dot-mode-on)
;; 
;; You may still want to use the global-set-key above.. especially if you
;; use the *scratch* buffer.
;;
;; To toggle dot mode on or off type `M-x dot-mode'
;;
;; There are only two variables that allow you to modify how dot-mode
;; behaves:
;;           dot-mode-ignore-undo
;;           dot-mode-global-mode
;;
;; dot-mode-ignore-undo - defaults to t.  When nil, it will record keystrokes
;;     that generate an undo just like any other keystroke that changed the
;;     buffer.  I personally find that annoying, but if you want dot-mode to
;;     always remember your undo's:
;;         (setq dot-mode-ignore-undo nil)
;;     Besides, you can always use dot-mode-override to record an undo when
;;     you need to (or even M-x undo).
;;
;; dot-mode-global-mode - defaults to t.  When t, dot-mode only has one
;;     keyboard command buffer.  That means you can make a change in one
;;     buffer, switch buffers, then repeat the change.  When set to nil,
;;     each buffer gets its own command buffer.  That means that after
;;     making a change in a buffer, if you switch buffers, that change
;;     cannot repeated.  If you switch back to the first buffer, your
;;     change can then be repeated again.  This has a nasty side effect
;;     if your change yanks from the kill-ring (You could end up
;;     yanking text you killed in a different buffer).
;;     If you want to set this to nil, you should do so before dot-mode
;;     is activated on any buffers.  Otherwise, you may end up with some
;;     buffers having a local command buffer and others using the global
;;     one.
;;
;; Usage instructions:
;;
;; `C-.'    is bound to dot-mode-execute, which executes the buffer of
;;          stored commands as a keyboard macro.
;;
;; `C-M-.'  is bound to dot-mode-override, which will cause dot-mode
;;          to remember the next keystroke regardless of whether it
;;          changes the buffer and regardless of the value of the
;;          dot-mode-ignore-undo variable.
;;
;; `C-c-.'  is bound to dot-mode-copy-to-last-kbd-macro, which will
;;          copy the current dot mode keyboard macro to the last-kbd-macro
;;          variable.  It can then be executed via call-last-kbd-macro
;;          (normally bound to `C-x-e'), named via name-last-kbd-macro,
;;          and then inserted into your .emacs via insert-kbd-macro.
;;
;; Known bugs:
;;
;; none

;;; COMMENTARY
;;;
;;; This mode is written to address one argument in the emacs vs. vi
;;; jihad :-)  It emulates the vi `redo' command, repeating the
;;; immediately preceding sequence of commands.  This is done by
;;; recording input commands which change the buffer, i.e. not motion
;;; commands.

;;; DESIGN
;;;
;;; The heart of this minor mode is a state machine.  The function
;;; dot-mode-after-change is called from after-change-functions and
;;; sets a variable (is there one already?  I couldn't find it) which
;;; is examined by dot-mode-loop, called from from post-command-hook.
;;; This variable, dot-mode-changed, is used in conjunction with
;;; dot-mode-state to move to the next state in the state machine.
;;; The state machine is hard coded into dot-mode-loop in the
;;; interests of speed; it uses two normal states (idle and store)
;;; and two corresponding override states which allow the user to
;;; forcibly store commands which do not change the buffer.

(defconst dot-mode-version "1.10"
  "Report bugs to: Robert Wyrick <rob@wyrick.org>")

;;; CHANGE HISTORY
;;;
;;; 1.1
;;; Wrote dot-mode.el
;;;
;;; 1.2
;;; At the suggestion of Scott Evans <gse@ocsystems.com>, added
;;; 'dot-mode-override' to allow the user to force dot mode to store a
;;; motion command
;;;
;;; 1.3
;;; Changed dot-mode-loop to use a state machine instead of several
;;; booleans
;;;
;;; 1.4
;;; Hard coded the state machine into dot-mode-loop in the hope of
;;; speeding it up
;;;
;;; 1.5
;;; Ported to GNU Emacs - nearly: the keymap doesn't seem to install
;;; correctly.
;;;
;;; 1.6
;;; Rob Wyrick (that's me) took over maintenance of the package from
;;; Jim Gillespie.
;;;
;;; In some versions of Emacs, (this-command-keys) returns a empty
;;; vector by the time it is called from the 'post-command-hook.
;;; So, I split the functionality... now dot-mode-command-keys
;;; stores (this-command-keys) output in a temp variable to be used
;;; by dot-mode-loop and dot-mode-command-keys is called from the
;;; pre-command-hook.  Also re/ported to XEmacs/GNU Emacs.  It works
;;; on both now.  dot-mode-command-keys could have been put on the
;;; after-change-functions hook, but I've begun preliminary work to
;;; capture what's going on in the minibuffer and I'm certain I need
;;; it where it is.
;;;
;;; 1.7
;;; Added my first attempt to capture what the user is doing with
;;; execute-extended-command (M-x).  It even works if the executed
;;; command prompts the user.
;;; Also added some error recovery if the user interrupts or there is
;;; an error during execution of the stored macro.
;;;
;;; 1.8
;;; Second attempt to capture what the user is doing with 
;;; execute-extended-command (M-x).  The previous version didn't work
;;; in XEmacs.  This version works in both XEmacs and GNUEmacs.
;;;
;;; 1.9
;;; Third attempt to capture what the user is doing with 
;;; execute-extended-command (M-x).  Wow was I making things hard.
;;; It's cost me a lot of version numbers in a short amount of time,
;;; so we won't discuss my previous attempts. *grin*  My second attempt
;;; worked just fine, but it was more complicated and maybe not as
;;; portable to older version of X/GNU Emacs.
;;; Other things:
;;;   - Yet another restructuring of the code.  By doing so, 
;;;     quoted-insert (C-q) is properly stored by dot-mode.
;;;     (quoted-insert has been broken since ver 1.6)
;;;   - Deleted an extraneous state and the "extended-state" added
;;;     in ver 1.8.  We're down to just two normal states and two
;;;     override states.
;;;   - Added dot-mode-ignore-undo and dot-mode-global-mode variables
;;;     as well as the new function dot-mode-copy-to-last-kbd-macro.
;;;
;;; 1.10
;;; Fixed a bug where the META key wasn't properly recorded on GNU
;;; Emacs.  Actually, if you used ESC for META (like me), everything
;;; worked fine.  But using ALT for META was broken.
;;; Now I'm using this-command-keys-vector when I can.
;;; I also added the dot-mode-event-to-string function to make the
;;; output a little prettier.
;;; Thanks to Scott Evans <gse@antisleep.com> for reporting the bug!
;;;
;;; 1.11
;;; Fixed a bug where dot-mode would give an error if you used
;;; dot-mode-override to record a <right> and then tried to call
;;; dot-mode-execute.  The bug was in dot-mode-event-to-string
;;; Thanks to Scott Evans <gse@antisleep.com> for reporting the bug!

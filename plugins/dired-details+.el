;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This enhances the functionality of library `dired-details.el'.
;;
;;
;;    NOTE: If you use Emacs 24.4 or later then you DO NOT NEED this
;;    library or library `dired-details.el'.  Instead, use
;;    `dired-hide-details-mode'.  Library `dired+.el' enhances
;;    `dired-hide-details-mode' to give it the save features as
;;    `dired-details+.el' provides.  Just use `(require 'dired+.el)'.
;;
;;
;;  `dired-details+.el' enhances `dired-details.el' in these ways:
;;
;;  1. It shrink-wraps Dired's frame whenever you show or hide
;;     details.  For this enhancement, you will need library
;;     `autofit-frame.el'.
;;
;;  2. It updates the listing whenever you create new files or
;;     directories or rename them.
;;
;;  3. It adds user option `dired-details-propagate-flag' which, if
;;     non-nil, propagates the last state you chose to the next Dired
;;     buffer you open.
;;
;;  4. It binds both `)' and `(' to `dired-details-toggle'.
;;
;;  Perhaps #2 corresponds to this TO-DO item in `dired-details.el':
;;
;;    * add a hook for dired-add-file to hide new entries as necessary
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `dired-details.el'
;;              has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `dired-details-activate' - If `dired-details-propagate-flag' is
;;                             non-nil, then use the last state.
;;
;;
;;  Put this in your initialization file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;   (require 'dired-details+)
;;
;;  I also recommend customizing `dired-details-hidden-string' to use
;;  the value "" instead of the default "[...]" - less wasted space.
;;
;;  Note: This library also calls `dired-details-install', activates
;;  show/hide and binds key `)'.

;;; Change Log:
;;
;; 2013/07/22 dadams
;;     Hard-require, not soft-require, dired-details.el.
;; 2013/07/19 dadams
;;     Mention in Commentary that you do not need dired-details(+).el for Emacs
;;       24.4 or later.
;; 2013/07/13 dadams
;;     If dired-hide-details-mode is defined, bind that to (, like vanilla Emacs.
;; 2011/01/04 dadams
;;     Added autoload cookies for defcustom.
;; 2009/06/07 dadams
;;     eval-after-load dired-details, and require dired.  Thx to Suvayu Ali.

;; 2008/03/28 dadams
;;     Do everything while widened.
;; 2008/03/08 dadams

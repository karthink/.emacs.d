;;; Commentary:

;; This package defines the function `iy-go-to-char' which behaves like "f" in
;; vim, and `iy-go-up-to-char` like "t" in vim.  It reads a char and go the
;; next Nth occurence of the char.  User can continue such search using that
;; char key.

;; To use, make sure this file is on your `load-path' and put the
;; following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'iy-go-to-char)
;;
;; To make `iy-go-to-char' works better with `multiple-cursors', add
;; `iy-go-to-char-start-pos' to `mc/cursor-specific-vars' when mc is loaded:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'mc/cursor-specific-vars 'iy-go-to-char-start-pos)
;;
;; Then you can bind functions like:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c f") 'iy-go-to-char)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c F") 'iy-go-to-char-backward)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c ;") 'iy-go-to-or-up-to-continue)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c ,") 'iy-go-to-or-up-to-continue-backward)
;;
;; Or if you prefer up-to (vim "t") versions:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c f") 'iy-go-up-to-char)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c F") 'iy-go-up-to-char-backward)
;;
;; You also can bind go-to methods and up-to methods to different keys.
;;
;; Except repeating the char key, followings keys are defined before
;; quitting the search:
;;
;;    ;   -- search forward the char, customizable:
;;           `iy-go-to-char-key-forward'
;;
;;    ,   -- search backward the char, customizable:
;;           `iy-go-to-char-key-backward'
;;
;;    C-g -- quit
;;
;;    C-s -- start `isearch-forward' using char as initial search
;;           string
;;
;;    C-r -- start `isearch-backward' using char as initial search
;;           string
;;
;;    C-w -- quit and kill region between start and current point.  If region is
;;           activated before search, then use the original mark instead of the
;;           start position.
;;
;;    M-w -- quit and save region between start and current point.  If region is
;;           activated before search, use the mark instead of start position.
;;
;; All other keys will quit the search.  Then the key event is
;; intepreted in the original environment before search.
;;
;; if the search quits because of error or using "C-g", point is set
;; back to the start position.  Otherwise, point is not change and the
;; start position is set as marker.  So you can use "C-x C-x" back to
;; that position.

;; `iy-go-to-char-backward' search backward by default.  Also the search can
;; cross lines.  To continue search last char, use `iy-go-to-char-continue' and
;; `iy-go-to-char-continue-backward'.

;;; Change Log:
;; 2013-04-28 (3.2.1)
;;
;;    - Fix documentations.
;;    - Add up-to versions: `iy-go-up-to-char', `iy-go-up-to-char-backward',
;;      `iy-go-up-to-char-continue' and `iy-go-up-to-char-continue-backward'.
;;
;; 2013-04-28 (3.1)
;;
;;    - Better integration with `multiple-cursors'.
;;    - Refactoring documentations.
;;
;; 2013-04-08 (3.0)
;;
;;    - When jump is started backward (with negative parameter, or
;;      `iy-go-to-char-backward'). Repeating continues the search
;;      backward. Also `iy-go-to-char-key-forward' jumps with the same
;;      direction when jump is started, and `iy-go-to-char-key-backward' jumps
;;      to reverse direction.
;;
;; 2013-03-25 (2.1)
;;    - Fix a but that I forget to set `mc--this-command'
;;
;; 2013-03-25 (2.0)
;;    - Use overriding-local-map to setup keymap
;;    - multiple-cursors compatible
;;
;; 2012-04-16 (1.1)
;;    - fix C-s/C-r to enter isearch
